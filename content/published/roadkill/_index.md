## Lyrics

```
Verse 1
Through winding roads, we claim our way
Fueled by ambition, we seize the day
With every mile, our spirits rise
The road, our ultimate prize

(Chorus)
Roadkill, they lie along the way
Lost souls, forsaken in disarray
Roadkill, their dreams left to decay
The fallen, mere casualties of yesterday

Verse 2
Through storms of doubt, we persevere
we march on, we banish fear
No roadkill shall mark our way
We embrace the road, come what may

(Bridge)
In the rearview mirror, their faces blur
Those who settled, their dreams interred
We press on, unyielding and strong
Fueling our souls with the road's eternal song
```
