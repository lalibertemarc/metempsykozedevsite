## Lyrics 

```
Verse 1
Is there any great power that could
Give me the strenght to revive?
This could be the right time
To prove them my real and true nature
Cause now, am I really worth it?
i feel like i could really use this
but it's all too far, so very far away from me

Verse 2
But this power never came
And forever dead I am, 
i think im pretty sure of it
but wait Why am I walking?
From the time I was alive
I used to be someone
But now, I have become something
Even greater than i thought

outro
Will you ever understand?
With these shadows in your head
Will you cry to make you see
That you dont need this to be free

Now I do understand
this was never meant to be
it should never have been mine
this was always out of line
```
