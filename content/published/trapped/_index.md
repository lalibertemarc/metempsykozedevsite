## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
Trapped in a world of darkness and pain
Space confines, driving me insane
My mind is racing, I can't keep still
I'm trapped in my thoughts, my own prison

Pre-Chorus:
I'm trapped in this cell, i can't find the key
My mind is a prison, can't break free
The bars are solid, can't see the light
My mind is in prison, i can't take the fight

Verse 2:
Every day's the same, it never ends
Pressure builds,  can't comprehend
The pain I feel, it's all too real
I'm drowning in, can't flee this ordeal

Pre-Chorus:
The world is closing, can't find the door
My mind is in prison, forevermore
The space is shrinking, can't breathe the air
My soul is in prison, its trapped in despair

Bridge:
I need to break free 
from the chains around me

Outro:
The chains are breaking, I'm finally free
The sky is clear, I can finally breathe

I'll cut these chains, with a sharpened mind
I'll leave this prison, leave it behind.

The past is gone, a new life begins
I'll never be trapped, never give in.

I'll rise from the ashes, like a phoenix reborn
I'll break these chains, and never be torn
