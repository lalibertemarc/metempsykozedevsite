## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
Dead of night, shadows creep
A world so dark, so complete
Terror and fear, all around
The only sound, a heartbeat pound

Chorus:
Horror in the night, a world so cold
Screams and cries, never grow old
In the grip of fear, we're all alone
Trapped inside, we can't go home

Bridge:
The shadows move, with baited breath
We know they're here, we feel their death
The darkness calls, a siren's song
We try to run, but it's too strong

In this place of terror, we lose our minds
The monsters win, they're one of a kind
We scream and shout, but no one hears
Our cries for help, fall on deaf ears

Verse 3 :
darkness consumes, our every thought
Our hope fades, as we are caught
We long for light, for a way out
The shadows laugh, and they shout

Outro:
In this place, we're not alone
Monsters lurk, in the unknown
Darkness hides, the things we fear
we can't escape, we're stuck here

We're trapped here, we can't escape
Terror and fear, a dark shape
Our minds are lost, in this night
forever trapped, horrid sight
