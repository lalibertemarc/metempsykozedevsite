## Lyrics
```
Verse 1 :
Once creators, now consumers we've turned
Seeking, the fires have burned
Our ambition's replaced by complacency
we surrender to this fallacy

Pre-chorus : 
Attention span dwindling, 
Focus dissipating

Chorus:
Slaves to the digital, our spirits confined
Enslaved, in the wires entwined
Addicted to digital, a craving embrace
Humanity entangled, an endless chase

Verse 2:
The gears of progress, they spin with might
Yet our minds grow dull, day and night
Wires suffocate, desires silenced
and still our spirits lose their will

Bridge :
Within the grip of addiction, a sliver of hope
Embracing the courage to break the slope
Escaping the clutches of the digital world
Reclaiming our freedom, a story to be told
```
