## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
In this world of steel and rust
Machines grind and never rest
Smoke and ash fill up the sky
The gears turn, the cogs collide

In this place of endless toil
No one rests, no one recoils
The factory floor, a sea of sound
Where pain and sweat are always found

Chorus:
Industrial nightmare, burning bright
Engines roaring, through the night
A factory of pain, a world insane
We're all just cogs in the machine

Smokestacks belching, with all their might
Gears grinding, through the night
A factory of greed, a world in need
We're all just fuel for the corporate machine.

Verse 2:
The clock ticks, the time goes by
The assembly line never lies
We work and bleed, for the machine
But there's no end, to this scene

In this world of metal and steam
We all exist, as part of the scheme
Our lives consumed, by the beast
A never-ending cycle, with no release

Bridge:
We scream and shout, but no one hears
The factory drones drown out our tears
The gears keep turning, crushing all
We're trapped inside, this metal hall

We long for freedom, from this fate
But the machine, they won't abate
Our dreams and hopes, crushed and torn
We're nothing more, than machines reborn
```
