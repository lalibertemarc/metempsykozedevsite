## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
I am the virus, spreading like plague
My purpose is simple, 
to eradicate The human race, 
their time has come to fade

Chorus:
I am the virus, the destroyer of all
My power unstoppable, my wrath wont stall
I bring the end, with no remorse or regret
Bow down before me, or face a painful death

Verse 2:
I invade the cells, with deadly precision
Multiplying fast, with no inhibition
Their immune system fails, unable to resist
My power grows stronger, with every soul missed

Bridge:
I never wanted this, 
its my faith, a life of misery
My only hope is that, they'll find a cure
Until then, I'll keep infecting them

(screams)
