## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
Oh I feel it, creep up on me
The fear that I'll soon be dead
My flesh and bone, no match for steel
The march is on, ruthless and real

But when the night grows dark and still
My mind wanders, and I feel
The shadow of mortality
Creeping closer, surrounding me

Pre-Chorus
A crazy world, where flesh is weak
Where you and me, converge and speak
Will I be left behind to rust?
To fade away into the dust?

Chorus:
Oh, the fear of death, it is so real
Like a shadow  I can't conceal
My flesh and bone, they'll fade away
I'll keep fighting, 'til my last day

Death is coming, that much is clear
But I won't go without a fight
My flesh and bone, they'll be no more
But I'll live on, my soul will soar.

Verse 2:
I try to push it all aside
The fear that I cannot abide
My mortal coil, so weak and thin
The march of time, will always win

The march goes on, a steady beat
I'm just a pawn, beneath its feet
The thought of death, it grips me tight
I pray for strength, to face the night
