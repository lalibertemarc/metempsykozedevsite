## Lyrics

```
Verse 1:
The scorching heat, it sears the land
A burning sun, a desolate strand
The skies are red, a fiery sight
Our souls are scorched, our hearts ignite

Bridge (black metal part) 1:
Flames of passion, they burn within
Raging fire, that drives our sin
We are the scourge, the bringers of pain
Our bright lord calls, we shall remain

The sun's harsh rays, they scorch the land
A burning heat, a barren strand
The earth is dry, a desert plain
Our souls are parched, our hearts in pain

Pre-chorus :
Follow the burning sun

Chorus:
Burning sun, our fiery fate
From the ashes rise, we shall create
Darkened souls, a demon's spawn
We are the ones who ride at dawn

Verse 2:
Our spirits strong, our wills unbroken
We march ahead, with words unspoken
To crush our foes, no fear unfelt
Our enemies burn, as they are dealt

Bridge (black metal part) 2:
The sun's fierce blaze, ignites our wrath
A scorching heat, that clears our path
To crush our foes, with passion and might
We are victors, in glory and light.

The sun's bright blaze, lights the earth
a warming heat, in my heart
The sky in flames, raging fire
Our souls ablaze, with burning desire

Outro:
The day is ours, our souls are free
We ride with power, for all to see
Our legacy, a burning sun
Our flames will rise, and victory won.
