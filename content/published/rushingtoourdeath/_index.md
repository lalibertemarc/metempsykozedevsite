## Lyrics

```
Chorus:
Rushing to our death, we cannot see
The end is near, our destiny
Our time is up, the hour is late
Our destiny's sealed, by our own fate.

Verse 1:
The clock ticks on, the end draws near
Humanity races towards its fear
The warnings ignored, the signs dismissed
Our own demise, we cannot resist

Pre-Chorus 1:
We feast on the fruits of our destruction
Blinded by greed and self-construction

Verse 2:
The earth screams out, in pain and sorrow
But we keep on, with no tomorrow
The oceans rise, the forests burn
Our fate is sealed, no one will learn

Bridge:
We had it all, but we threw it away
The price we pay, we cannot delay
We must wake up, before it's too late
Or face the consequences, of our own hate

Outro:
The end is nigh, our time is done
Our fate is sealed, we can't outrun 
The end draws near, our time has passed
Our fate is sealed, our die is cast.
