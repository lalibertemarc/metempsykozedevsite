## Lyrics

```
Verse1:
Within the chambers of my mind,
a dissonance I cant find,
a discord that leaves me blind.

Days unfold in monotone,
no seeds of joy, no roots are sown,
an existence silently overthrown.

I once held happiness in my grasp,
now it slips, a fleeting clasp,
leaving me in a joyless rasp.

only one thing left to see
only anger dwells inside of me

pre-chorus:
when you are in a state like this
no point in trying to dismiss
only one thing left to kiss
before the bliss

Chorus:
Anhedonia
I can't feel anything
I can't sing at all

Echoes in a silent hall,
no melodies, no soulful call.
I can't scream at all

Verse2:
Haunted by a silent scream,
chasing after a fleeting dream,
reality tearing at the seam.

Drifting through a monochrome haze,
lost in life's bewildering maze,
unraveling in this self-made daze.

I've tried to break the chains,
but apathy in my veins remains,
echoes of laughter turn to strains.

No tears left for the sorrow,
no hope for a better tomorrow,
in this emptiness, I borrow.

Bridge :
Only when I throw it all away
am i able the see myself astray
only then i can feel joy again
and my life is now without the pain
```
